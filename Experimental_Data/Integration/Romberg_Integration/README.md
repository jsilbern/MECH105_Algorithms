# Romberg Integration
Estimates the integral of a function using Romberg Integration
## Inputs
* f = the function to be integrated
* a = the lower bound of integration
* b = the upper bound of integration
* n = the number of iterations of the romberg equation
## Outputs
* I = the integration estimate
* ea = the approximate relative error for the integration iterations
