# Romberg Differentiation
Estimates the derivative of a function using Romberg Derivation
## Inputs
* f = the function to be derivated
* a = the lower bound of derivation
* b = the upper bound of derivation
* n = the number of iterations of the romberg equation
## Outputs
* I = the derivative estimate
* ea = the approximate relative error for the derivation iterations
